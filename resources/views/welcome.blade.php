                        <p class="library_text">A library is a collection of sources of information and similar
                            resources, made accessible to a defined community for
                            reference or borrowing. It provides physical or digital access to material and may be a
                            physical building or room, or a
                            virtual space, or both.

                            <br /><br />
                            A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers,
                            manuscripts, films, maps,
                            prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books,
                            audiobooks, databases, and other
                            formats. Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books to several million items.
                            Sidney Sheldon perfectly
                            describes: “Libraries store the energy that fuels the imagination. They open up windows to
                            the world and inspire us to
                            explore and achieve, and contribute to improving our quality of life.”
                            <br /><br />
                            Laura Bush in her famous quote said: “I have found the most valuable thing in my wallet is
                            my library card.” Visit your
                            library, get your library card, and you’ll be able to borrow a print or electronic book, use
                            free internet, or attend a
                            course that will improve your digital skills.
